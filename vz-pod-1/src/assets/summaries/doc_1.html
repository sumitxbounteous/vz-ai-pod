                    <p><strong>Maine Broadband Customer Privacy Rights</strong></p>
                    <p>The Maine Broadband Internet Access Service Customer Privacy Act, effective on July 1, 2020,
                        gives
                        you additional privacy rights when we are your broadband Internet access service provider. The
                        Maine
                        law gives you the right to control certain ways that we use or share information we have about
                        you
                        and requires that we provide you with a notice of your rights and our obligations under this
                        law. We
                        do this in this section.<br><br>We will not use, disclose, sell, or permit access to your
                        broadband
                        customer personal information except for purposes allowed under the Maine law or with your
                        affirmative consent. We may ask you for this consent when we interact with you. For example, we
                        may
                        ask to use your broadband customer personal information to market additional services to you
                        when
                        you call us or come into our stores.<br><br>The Maine law also provides you with a right to
                        opt-out
                        of any use or sharing of data that is not customer personal information under the law. At this
                        time,
                        we do not collect information about you as a broadband customer that is not customer personal
                        information. If we begin collecting such information in the future, we will give you the right
                        to
                        opt out of its use and sharing.<br><br>We will not refuse to provide you with broadband service,
                        charge you a penalty, or offer you a discount based on whether you agree that we can use or
                        share
                        your broadband customer personal information.<br><br>Many services and applications offered
                        through
                        your device may be provided by third parties. When you access and use third-party services,
                        including third-party services which Verizon may make available as part of or in connection with
                        your Verizon Service, you are subject to the terms of service and privacy policy issued by those
                        third-party providers when using their services. You should review their applicable terms and
                        privacy policy before you use, link to or download a service or application provided by a third
                        party.</p>
                    <p><strong>Can Verizon change this Agreement or my Service?</strong></p>
                    <p>If you use your Service after the change takes effect that means you're accepting the change.
                        Notwithstanding this provision, if we make any changes to the dispute resolution provision of
                        this
                        Agreement, such changes will not affect the resolution of any disputes that arose before such
                        change, unless you want them to apply to a pending dispute.</p>
                    <p><strong>Internet access</strong></p>
                    <p>If you download or use applications, services or software provided by third parties (including
                        voice
                        applications), 911 or E911, or other calling functionality, may work differently than services
                        offered by us, or may not work at all. Please review all terms and conditions of such

                    <p><strong>Where and how does Verizon wireless Service work?</strong></p>
                    <p>Wireless devices, including in-vehicle hotspots, use radio transmissions, so unfortunately you
                        can't
                        get Service if your device isn't in range of a transmission signal. And please be aware that
                        even
                        within your Coverage Area, many things can affect the availability and quality of your Service,
                        including network capacity, your device, terrain, buildings, foliage and weather.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is roaming?</strong></p>
                    <p>You're "roaming" whenever your wireless device connects to a network outside your Coverage Area
                        or
                        connects to another carrier's network, which could happen even within your Coverage Area. There
                        may
                        be higher rates or extra charges (including charges for long distance, tolls or calls that don't
                        connect), and your data service may be limited or slowed, when roaming.</p>
                    <p><strong>What are my rights for dropped calls or interrupted Service?</strong></p>
                    <p>If you lose Service in your Coverage Area for more than 4 hours in a row and we're at fault, call
                        us
                        within 80 days and we'll give you a credit for the time lost. Please be aware that these are
                        your
                        only rights for dropped calls or interrupted Service.</p>
                    <p><strong>Billing and payments</strong></p>
                    <p>As described in the HMA Connected Services Agreement Terms and Conditions, available at:&nbsp;<a
                            href="https://owners.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/terms-and-conditions"
                            target="_blank">https://owners.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/terms-and-conditions</a>, all billing
                        and
                        payment will be conducted by HMA as part of your subscription and data plan purchased through
                        HMA.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>What are Verizon's rights to limit or end Service or end this Agreement?</strong></p>
                    <p>We can, without notice, limit, suspend or end your Service or any agreement with you for any good
                        cause, including, but not limited to: (1) if you: (a) breach this agreement or violate our
                        prohibited usage policies; (b) resell your Service; (c) use your Service for any illegal
                        purpose,
                        including use that violates trade and economic sanctions and prohibitions promulgated by any US
                        governmental agency; (d) install, deploy or use any regeneration equipment or similar mechanism
                        (for
                        example, a repeater) to originate, amplify, enhance, retransmit or regenerate an RF signal
                        without
                        our permission; (e) steal from or lie to us; or (2) if you, or any user of your device or any
                        line
                        of service on your account, or any account manager on your account: (a) threaten, harass, or use
                        vulgar and/or inappropriate language toward our representatives; (b) interfere with our
                        operations;
                        (c) "spam," or engage in other abusive messaging or calling; (d) modify your device from its
                        manufacturer’s specifications; or (e) use your Service in a way that negatively affects our
                        network
                        or other customers. We can also temporarily limit your Service for any operational or
                        governmental
                        reason.</p>
                    <p><strong>WAIVERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>You and Verizon both agree to limit claims against each other solely to direct damages.
                            This
                            means that to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, neither of us will claim any
                            damages
                            that are indirect, special, consequential, incidental, treble, or punitive, regardless of
                            the
                            theory of liability. For example, disallowed damages include those arising out of a Service
                            or
                            device failure, unauthorized access or changes to your account or device, or the use of your
                            account or device by others to authenticate, access or make changes to a third-party
                            account,
                            such as a financial or cryptocurrency account, including changing passwords or transferring
                            or
                            withdrawing funds. This limitation also applies if you bring a claim against one of our
                            suppliers, to the extent we would be required to indemnify the supplier for the
                            claim.</strong>&nbsp;You agree we aren't responsible for problems caused by you or others,
                        or by
                        any act of God. If another wireless carrier is involved in any problem (for example, while
                        you're
                        roaming), you also agree to any limitations of liability that it imposes.</p>
                    <p><strong>HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH VERIZON?</strong></p>
                    <p>WE HOPE TO MAKE YOU A HAPPY CUSTOMER, BUT IF THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, THIS
                        SECTION
                        OUTLINES WHAT’S EXPECTED OF BOTH OF US.<br><br>YOU AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES
                        ONLY
                        BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS DISCUSSED BELOW. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO
                        THE
                        TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A
                        JURY. ALTHOUGH THE PROCEDURES IN ARBITRATION MAY BE DIFFERENT, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE
                        SAME
                        DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD, SUBJECT
                        TO
                        THE LIMITS ON ARBITRATOR AUTHORITY SET FORTH BELOW. IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS'
                        FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. THE SAME DEFENSES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO BOTH PARTIES AS
                        WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE
                        THAT:<br><br>(1) THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS
                        COURT CASES OR AS SPECIFICALLY NOTED BELOW, ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO, OR ARISES
                        OUT
                        OF, THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE RESOLVED BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN
                        ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA"), OR BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ("BBB"), AS EXPLAINED BELOW IN
                        PARAGRAPH
                        2. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY, OR
                        SCOPE OF ANY PORTION OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE), ANY EQUIPMENT,
                        PRODUCTS AND SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US, ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR
                        ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY OR INVASION OF PRIVACY RELATING TO SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND
                        INCLUDES
                        ANY DISPUTES YOU HAVE WITH OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS. YOU CAN ALSO BRING ANY ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE
                        TO
                        THE ATTENTION OF FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND IF THE LAW ALLOWS, THEY CAN

                        RELIEF AGAINST US FOR YOU. THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CONTINUES TO APPLY EVEN AFTER YOU HAVE
                        STOPPED RECEIVING SERVICE FROM US.<br><br>(2) UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
                        ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTY OF YOUR BILLING ADDRESS. THE AAA'S CONSUMER
                        ARBITRATION
                        RULES WILL APPLY. IF THE AAA REFUSES TO ENFORCE ANY PART OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU AND
                        VERIZON WILL SELECT ANOTHER ARBITRATOR. IF THERE IS NO AGREEMENT, A COURT IN THE COUNTY OF YOUR
                        BILLING ADDRESS WILL SELECT AN ARBITRATOR TO DECIDE THE DISPUTE. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN
                        THIS
                        AGREEMENT, AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATOR APPOINTED TO DETERMINE THE MERITS OF THE DISPUTE SHALL HAVE
                        EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO ARBITRATE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE
                        VALIDITY,
                        ENFORCEABILITY OR SCOPE OF ANY PORTION OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE).
                        YOU
                        CAN GET PROCEDURES, RULES AND FEE INFORMATION FROM THE AAA (<a href="http://www.adr.org/"
                            target="_blank">WWW.ADR.ORG</a>), THE BBB (<a href="https://www.bbb.org/"
                            target="_blank">WWW.BBB.ORG</a>) OR FROM US. FOR CLAIMS OF $25,000 OR LESS, YOU CAN CHOOSE
                        WHETHER YOU’D LIKE THE ARBITRATION CARRIED OUT BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE
                        ARBITRATOR,
                        OR BY A HEARING IN PERSON OR BY PHONE. ALTERNATIVELY, FOR CLAIMS WITHIN THE JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT
                        OF
                        THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT IN THE STATE ENCOMPASSING YOUR BILLING ADDRESS, EITHER YOU OR VERIZON CAN
                        CHOOSE TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF PROCEEDING IN ARBITRATION;
                        FURTHERMORE, IF THE CLAIMS IN ANY REQUEST OR DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN
                        SMALL
                        CLAIMS COURT, THEN EITHER YOU OR VERIZON MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE THE CLAIMS HEARD IN SMALL CLAIMS
                        COURT,
                        RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE ARBITRATOR IS APPOINTED BY NOTIFYING THE
                        OTHER
                        PARTY OF THAT CHOICE IN WRITING. IF THIS PROVISION OR THE LIMITATION ON BRINGING ACTIONS TO
                        SMALL
                        CLAIMS COURT IS FOUND TO BE INVALID, THEN THIS PROVISION SHALL BE SEVERABLE AND THE MATTER WILL
                        PROCEED IN ARBITRATION; IN NO WAY WILL THIS PROVISION ALLOW FOR AN ACTION TO BE BROUGHT ON A
                        CLASS
                        OR COLLECTIVE BASIS.<br><br>(3) THIS AGREEMENT DOESN’T ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS
                        EVEN
                        IF THE AAA OR BBB PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS
                        AGREEMENT,
                        THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY
                        SEEKING
                        RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL
                        CLAIM. NO CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR GENERAL INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
                        THEORIES OF
                        LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

                        SHALL
                        BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.<br><br>(4) IF EITHER OF US INTENDS TO SEEK

                        THE VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMERS BRINGING THE CLAIMS ARE THE SAME OR COORDINATED FOR THESE
                        CUSTOMERS,
                        THE CLAIMS SHALL PROCEED IN ARBITRATION IN A COORDINATED PROCEEDING. IN THE FIRST STAGE, 50
                        ARBITRATIONS WILL PROCEED, AND COUNSEL FOR THE VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMERS AND COUNSEL FOR
                        VERIZON

                        VERIZON CUSTOMERS AND COUNSEL FOR VERIZON SHALL EACH SELECT 10 CASES TO PROCEED IN ARBITRATION
                        IN
                        INDIVIDUAL BELLWETHER PROCEEDINGS BEFORE SEPARATE ARBITRATORS. AFTER THE SECOND STAGE IS
                        COMPLETED,
                        THE PARTIES MUST ENGAGE IN A MEDIATION OF ALL REMAINING CASES, AND VERIZON WILL PAY THE
                        MEDIATION
                        FEE. AFTER THE SECOND SET OF ARBITRATIONS AND MEDIATION CONCLUDE, IF THE PARTIES CANNOT AGREE
                        HOW TO
                        RESOLVE THE REMAINING CLAIMS, ANY INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER WHO IS PART OF THIS COORDINATED

                        VERIZON, MAY ELECT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BY PROVIDING NOTICE TO OPPOSING COUNSEL, AND IF THE
                        CUSTOMER WISHES TO PROCEED WITH THE CLAIM THEY MAY FILE AN INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINT IN COURT. FOR
                        THOSE
                        CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, THEIR CLAIMS WILL PROCEED IN ARBITRATION IN
                        CONTINUED
                        BATCHES OF 80 CLAIMS AS SET FORTH ABOVE FOR THE SECOND SET. ADDITIONAL CASES INVOLVING SIMILAR
                        CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE SAME OR COORDINATED COUNSEL SHALL NOT BE FILED IN ARBITRATION UNTIL THE
                        ARBITRATIONS AND MEDIATION FOR PRIOR SETS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. YOU AGREE TO THIS PROCESS EVEN
                        THOUGH
                        IT MAY DELAY THE ARBITRATION OF YOUR CLAIM. IF SUCH A PROCESS IS INITIATED, THE FILING OF A
                        NOTICE
                        OF DISPUTE BY A CUSTOMER IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 4 OR FILING OF A COMPLAINT IN COURT WILL

                        INCLUDING
                        BY ENTERING AN INJUNCTION TO PROHIBIT FILINGS IN VIOLATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH.<br><br>(7) AN
                        ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO THAT SPECIFIC CASE; IT CAN’T BE
                        USED
                        IN ANY OTHER CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE THE AWARD ITSELF.<br><br>(8) IF A COURT, PURSUANT TO
                        PARAGRAPH
                        3, DETERMINES THAT THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS OR THE LIMITS ON THE ARBITRATOR'S
                        AUTHORITY
                        CANNOT BE ENFORCED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW AS TO ALL OR PART OF A DISPUTE, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO
                        ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY TO THAT DISPUTE OR PART OF THE DISPUTE, WHICH MAY PROCEED IN COURT ONCE
                        THE
                        ARBITRATED MATTERS HAVE CONCLUDED OR SOONER IF THE COURT SO REQUIRES.<br><br>(9) IF FOR ANY
                        REASON A
                        CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, INCLUDING IF A CUSTOMER OR VERIZON OPT
                        OUT
                        OF ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (6) ABOVE, YOU AND VERIZON AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST
                        EXTENT
                        ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NO ACTION WILL BE BROUGHT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS AND YOU AND

                        COUNTERCLAIM
                        ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS
